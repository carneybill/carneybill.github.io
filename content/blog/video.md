As technology continues to reshape how audiences engage with content, two advertising trends are capturing marketers' attention: livestreaming and video advertising. These formats not only align with evolving consumer habits but also offer unparalleled opportunities for brands to build connections, drive awareness, and boost sales.  

## Looking to Livestreaming  

Livestreaming has become a dominant force in markets like China, where platforms such as **Taobao Live**, **Douyin**, and **WeChat** reach nearly half the population. The appeal is clear: livestreaming combines entertainment with e-commerce, creating an interactive, engaging experience that resonates with viewers. By 2026, it’s projected that **live-commerce sales will account for 20% of total retail sales** in China.  

The impact of livestreaming ads goes beyond immediate purchases. According to Kantar, livestreaming boosts both short-term purchase intent and long-term brand affinity. Established brands can use livestreaming to strengthen emotional connections and reinforce brand identity. Meanwhile, small to mid-sized brands benefit from the format’s ability to quickly generate awareness and drive immediate interest.  

For brands considering livestreaming, the opportunity is immense. With careful planning and alignment to audience preferences, livestreaming can be a powerful addition to any advertising strategy.  

## Embarking on the Voyage to Video  

In today’s media landscape, the distinction between traditional broadcast TV and streaming services is fading. Viewers now seamlessly switch between live TV, subscription video-on-demand (SVOD), and ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) platforms. For marketers, this shift represents both a challenge and an opportunity.  

**Kantar predicts** that investment in broadcast TV advertising will continue but will increasingly be spread across the broader TV portfolio, including streaming and video platforms. To thrive in this environment, marketers need to take a nuanced approach:  

- **Experiment Across Platforms**: A mix of traditional broadcast, SVOD, and AVOD ensures you reach diverse audience segments.  
- **Test and Learn**: Continually refine your strategy based on performance data to identify the right balance for your brand.  
- **Embrace Flexibility**: Adapt to emerging trends, such as personalized video content and interactive ads, to stay ahead of the curve.  

By blending traditional and digital video advertising, brands can create campaigns that maximize reach and resonate deeply with audiences.  

## The Future is Interactive and Immersive  

As livestreaming and video advertising continue to grow, the future of marketing lies in **interactive and immersive experiences**. These formats don’t just inform—they engage, entertain, and invite consumers to participate. For brands willing to embrace innovation and adapt to changing consumer behaviors, the potential is limitless.  

Whether through livestreaming platforms or streaming video ads, the key is to create authentic, compelling narratives that connect with audiences in real-time and leave a lasting impression. The time to invest in these formats is now—because the future of advertising is already here.
