excerpt: "There are no proven levers, no predictable attribution models, and no map to follow. Growth now emerges from signals hiding in plain sight: who’s talking about you at private CIO dinners, which founders are shaping the narrative, what ideas are earning trust among peers. Lets explore what’s breaking in traditional marketing and what’s working instead."

A new pattern is emerging - teams that stop applying templates and start diagnosing where influence and credibility truly live are the ones winning. The next generation of marketing leaders won’t look like SaaS operators. They’ll be experimenters, inventors, and network-builders — people who turn curiosity into compound growth.

## The SaaS Playbooks Don’t Map

Let’s recap what’s shifted, so the stakes are clear.
1.	Peer-influence & trust over mass channels
In AI / deep tech, decision makers (CIOs, CTOs, enterprise buyers) often talk to their peers first. They hear of new tools via private gatherings, events, word of mouth in their network. If your marketing doesn’t amplify or enable those signals, you miss the channel that actually moves revenue.
2.	Narrative, founder & thought leadership as channels
Founders or technical leads becoming visible — speaking, writing, doing podcasts, being “nodes” of influence — are no longer optional. They are core to establishing trust. Customers buy not only the product, but who stands behind it, how they think, and what their reputation says.
3.	Nonlinear, noisy buyer journeys
Buyers often see you via reputation, research, event exposure, or referrals before any inbound or demand-gen campaign kicks off. Attribution becomes messy; traditional funnels break.
4.	Experimentation + measurement matter more than known “best” channels
Because many of the high-leverage channels are less baked (peer events, community, thought leadership, influencer relationships in tech), leaders must act like scientists: try hypotheses, test early signals, double down, kill fast.
5.	Risk & leadership exposure are high
With fast-moving AI markets, hyper-competition, and demands from investors, CMOs who cling too closely to old template thinking risk being seen as not responsive enough. Hence the feeling: “maybe I’ll be fired in 18 months.”

## What “Diagnosing Before Prescribing” Looks Like in Action

Here’s what the difference looks like in practice — founders + CMOs who succeed in AI / deep tech don’t immediately deploy ABM or demand-gen just because that’s what worked in SaaS. They start with discovery:
- What signals are already driving growth (even if small)?
- Which peer networks / events / people / content are people hearing us from or talking about?
- Where are the bottlenecks or leaks in our influence-journey (not just funnel)?
- Which experiments are cheap to run, yield early signals, and can be scaled if successful.

Then build the motion around that instead of shoehorning old blueprints.

## Case Studies / Examples: What Working Looks Like

Here are several real (or close to real) examples that illustrate how some companies are doing this well — diagnosing, testing, leaning into influence / narrative / community — not just executing known demand-gen motions.

⸻

### Case Study 1: Gradient AI + Enterprise Influencer Marketing

What they did:
- Company: Gradient AI, an enterprise AI company.  ￼
- Challenge: As an enterprise AI business, marketing budget was tight; traditional influencer marketing is rarely used in enterprise sales. They needed credibility and visibility among AI experts and decision makers.  ￼

Approach / Experimentation:
- Engage creators/influencers who are themselves technical (AI software engineers, ML practitioners, data science experts) so that content resonates deeply.  ￼
- Run campaigns with A/B testing of different message features, highlighting various technical/product differentiators.  ￼
- The CEO / co-founder was personally involved. This wasn’t delegated. Founder voice was used to signal authenticity.  ￼

Results:
- Hundreds of relevant creators reached out; dozens of content contracts executed.  ￼
- Immediate inbound sales: technology was seen by AI experts (which then led to enterprise leads).  ￼

Why it matters: This is diagnosing what credibility and peer exposure can produce. Instead of starting with ABM or demand-gen, they treated influencer / creator communities as levers relevant even for enterprise B2B.

⸻

### Case Study 2: AI Founders + PUNKU.AI for Startup Scouting

What they did:
- Company: AI Founders (an AI accelerator / startup-incubator in Europe) + PUNKU.AI (tool/partner)  ￼
- Challenge: They wanted to improve the quality and geographic reach of applications to the accelerator. Their previous recruiting / scouting was manual, expensive, slow, and had limited reach.  ￼

Approach:
- Use AI-powered identification of promising startups across Europe.  ￼
- Automated, personalized outreach—messages crafted to reflect understanding of each startup’s tech and market.  ￼
- Follow-ups / engagement were managed with tools that scale outreach + nurture. Not generic templated mass mail; relatively high signal personalization.  ￼

Results: Between Batch 4 → 5 of the accelerator program, applications increased 179 %, with only a 50 % increase in outreach contacts. PUNKU.AI drove 43 % of total applications, and ~⅓ of accepted startups came through that channel.  ￼

What this shows: Founders can invent new motions where none existed. They diagnosed that scouting/outreach was the bottleneck, then built around that insight; they didn’t force-fit a demand-gen or ABM tactic.

⸻

### Case Study 3: Founder as Thought Leader / Viral Visibility

What they did:
- Company: Anonymous but an AI-SaaS company with ~50 million users globally; lean (~28 people).  ￼
- Challenge: Product and traction exist, but lacked visibility of the founder and thought leadership. The market sees products, but often misses the story, the philosophy, the differentiator. They needed to be seen as not just another AI product, but as a leader in how AI can scale with lean teams, profitability, etc.  ￼

Approach:
- Develop content strategy around counterintuitive or contrarian insights: e.g. “Tiny teams of extraordinary people,” “Why traditional startup playbooks are broken,” etc. Write strong posts, publish them with consistency.  ￼
- Use formats that engage: LinkedIn / founder posts, thoughtful commentary, storytelling. Use the founder’s voice.

Results:
- ~3 million views across content posts. Individual posts got 7,000+ likes and hundreds of comments.  ￼
- Follower base grew ~195 % to over 40,000. Engagement soared: comments and interactions rose dramatically.  ￼

Why it matters: This is classic thought leadership + narrative + founder voice. It’s not demand-gen in the sense of ABM or funnel metrics. But it pulls in visibility, credibility, trust — which feed the funnel in subtle but powerful ways. Also, it scales: one voice, one narrative, many reads.

## Synthesizing: Deep Tech Marketing 

From these case studies and what we see in the field, the leaders who are succeeding have some or all of:

| Practice                   | What they do                     | Why it works in AI/Deep Tech|
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
Hypothesis-driven experiments|	Try small bets: test influencer content, founder posts, founder visibility, peer event sponsorship.	| Channels are new; early signals matter more than playbooks.|
Founder / technical leader visibility & influence| Founders create content, speak, get involved in networks; use their credibility.| Deep tech/social proof demands credibility; trust comes from signal of authority or insight.|
Peer / community network leverage| Influencers/creators in a domain, events, private forums, speaking at niche meetups, technical community content.| Buyers actually get recommendations here — low noise, high trust.|
Measurement beyond last-click| Track inbound references, source of inspiration, surveys (“what made you first hear of us?”), leading indicators (referrals, event leads). Using cohort comparisons.| Funnel models mis-attribute peer influence or narrative; need qualitative + quantitative.|
Budgeting for uncertainty & optionality| Keeping a portion of budget & talent for experiments; being willing to kill rather than scaling prematurely.| Because channels are newer, risk higher; but reward for early movers is also large.

## Implications & What to Do Next

Here are concrete steps if you’re a founder or CMO in an AI / deep tech company and you want to build marketing that “gets it.”
1.	Do a drift audit: Identify existing successful traction signals — maybe small ones — that came “outside the plan.” Interview customers: “How did you hear about us? Who referred you? What content or event did you see?” These are clues for high-leverage channels.
2.	Map influence nodes: Where do your customers or buyers spend time? What are the conferences, Slack / Discord / private forums, podcasts, workshops where they talk? Who are the respected influencers or technical voices in your space?
3.	Make your founder / technical team visible: Start small if needed (founder blog posts, guest appearances, speaking at niche podcasts, publishing technical insights). Use them to signal authenticity and domain expertise.
4.	Run many small experiments: For example:
  - Sponsor small dinners / workshops where peers can meet (CIO dinners, tech salons).
  - Run a creator / influencer campaign among technical creators.
  - Try alternate messaging hypotheses via content.
  - Run surveys to capture qualitative feedback on what messages/narratives resonated.
5.	Track and measure leading indicators: Not just pipeline/closed deals, but:
  - Inbound mentions / referrals
  - Event leads after peer group or conference exposure
  - Content reach + engagement (especially among technical audience)
  - Survey data on “first touch” or “influencer exposure”
6.	Be ready to kill fast: If something is not working, discard or pivot. Don’t throw budgets at legacy channels just because “everyone does ABM or demand gen.”
7.	Hire differently: Look for marketing leaders with growth / product / experiment mindset. Who are comfortable operating in ambiguity, inventing where nothing is proven.

## Moving from Operator → Inventor

To sum up, the next generation of marketing leaders in AI / deep tech won’t be those who can flawlessly run demand-gen, SEO, ABM in template forms. They’ll be inventors:
- Diagnose first: understand what is actually working, again and again, even if quietly.
- Invent around those signals. Take the best available insights and build new playbooks.
- Iterate quickly. Measure both quantitative and qualitative signals.
- Build influence & trust as central parts of GTM (go-to-market), not as “nice extras.”

Interestingly, this is what many growth teams have done historically (hacking, experimentation) — but now that narrative / influence / credibility channels are so potent in AI, growth mindset needs to lead marketing as a whole.

⸻

In today’s fragmented buyer landscape, where decisions are increasingly shaped by peer influence rather than predictable funnels, “template marketing” no longer works. The founders and CMOs who succeed are those who embrace uncertainty, lean into networks of influence, make the founder’s story visible, and approach growth as a series of disciplined experiments. We’re in the midst of an arms race for attention and trust—early movers who build influence, author the narrative, and intentionally map the ecosystems around them will capture outsized returns.
