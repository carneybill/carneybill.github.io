excerpt: "Marketing isn’t just about conversions—it’s about sticking in your customers’ minds. The brands we remember aren’t always the best; they’re the ones that show up consistently, dominating our thoughts through sheer visibility. By investing in share of voice (SOV) and creating unforgettable, omnipresent campaigns, brands can outpace their competitors and drive market share growth."

# Marketing: It’s Not About Selling—It’s About Sticking  

Let’s be real for a second: marketing isn’t just about converting customers; it’s about *haunting* them. You know the drill—you need a solution, and the first brand that pops into your head isn’t necessarily the best one. It’s the one that’s been camping out in your brain rent-free, showing up over and over like your favorite meme.  

That’s the game. Marketing isn’t just about moving people down a funnel; it’s about making sure you’re the brand they remember when it’s go-time. And the secret sauce to making that happen? **Visibility.**

## It’s a Memory Game, Not a Numbers Game  

Here’s the thing: most companies—especially in B2B—are obsessed with tracking every marketing dollar directly to a sale. They’re looking at conversion rates and funnel metrics like they’re deciphering the Rosetta Stone. But here’s what they’re missing: the brands that dominate markets don’t just play the numbers game; they play the memory game.  

### Why? Because People Buy What They Remember  
Think about it. When you’re choosing a product or service, you don’t go scouring every corner of the internet for the best option. You go with what you *know*—and what you know is usually the brand that’s been showing up consistently.

## Share of Voice: The Marketing Cheat Code  

If you want to win the memory game, you need to get loud. Enter **Share of Voice (SOV)**—the ultimate marketing flex. SOV is your brand’s share of total market advertising, and it’s a direct line to market share growth.  

Here’s a mic-drop stat from **Nielsen**:  
For every **10% increase in Excess Share of Voice (ESOV)**, a brand can grow its market share by around **0.5% annually**. That means the louder you are compared to your competitors, the more of the market you grab.  

### Translation?  
Stop being modest and make some noise.

## Consistency: The Real MVP  

It’s not enough to show up once and hope for the best. The brands that dominate are the ones that are *always* there. Think Coca-Cola. Think Apple. These brands don’t rely on flashy one-off campaigns—they rely on showing up everywhere, all the time.  

### How to Build a Brand That Sticks:  
1. **Be Ubiquitous**: Use every channel at your disposal—social, podcasts, video, digital ads, you name it.  
2. **Stay Consistent**: Don’t confuse your audience with mixed messages. Keep your branding and tone on point.  
3. **Create Memorable Content**: Be clever, be bold, and most importantly, be unforgettable.

## But Isn’t There Such a Thing as Too Much Visibility?  

Nope.  

Here’s the deal: brands that over-invest in visibility consistently see growth. If you’re worried about being “too loud,” just remember this—when brands go quiet, they disappear. Visibility isn’t about vanity; it’s about survival.  

---

## Stop Playing Small  

Marketing is about more than conversions. It’s about staying top of mind so that when your customers are ready to buy, you’re the first name they think of. The brands that win are the ones that make themselves unforgettable—over and over and over again.  

So, stop worrying about vanity metrics and start playing the long game. Because in marketing, the loudest voice is the one people remember.  

**Ready to stick in your customers’ minds? Start making some noise.**
