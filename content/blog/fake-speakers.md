Anna Boyko, touted as a featured speaker at DevTernity, was presented with an impressive profile that left attendees in awe. However, attempts to verify her existence were met with an unsettling silence from Coinbase employees and Ethereum core contributors. The truth emerged: Anna Boyko was a figment of the organizers' imagination, a deliberate fabrication.

But Boyko wasn't the sole victim of this deceit. Alina Prokhoda, claimed to be a "Senior Engineer at WhatsApp, Microsoft MVP," was another product of the organizers' deception. The ruse extended to JDKon, another event orchestrated by the same group, where a non-existent Natalie Stadler was introduced as a "Software Craftswoman at Coinbase."

The deception even seeped into past events, as Julia Kirsina, supposedly a "Software Craftswoman, Tech Influencer @ Instagram," repeatedly appeared on DevTernity's speaker lineup for three consecutive years without ever delivering a talk. An investigation hinted at the possibility that the profile might be linked to a man, further amplifying the organizers' lack of scruples.

The burning question is: Why would a supposedly reputable conference stoop to such unethical measures? The answer appears to be an attempt to camouflage diversity concerns. By inserting fake women speakers, the organizers sought to superficially present a more diverse lineup, dodging potential refusals from high-profile speakers and customer complaints about the lack of diversity.

This revelation marks a disgraceful low point in the history of tech conferences, as DevTernity's actions not only tarnish its own credibility but also cast a shadow over other events. Outraged  professionals are now calling for rigorous scrutiny when considering participation in conferences associated with these organizers.

For those genuinely seeking authentic and diverse voices in tech, alternative resources are strongly recommended. Initiatives like Diversify Tech provide a platform to post calls for papers, reaching 15,000 underrepresented individuals for free. Scott Hanselman's podcast, featuring a diverse array of guests, offers a pool of 920+ compelling profiles. As the tech community grapples with this scandal, organizers are urged to approach potential speakers with respect and offer fair compensation, recommitting to the values of diversity and authenticity in the tech conference landscape.
