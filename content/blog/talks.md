excerpt: "We want personal data in exchange for content we kill ourselves to create. We also want to establish ourselves as thought leader and have a degree of authority in our space. There has always been a need to balance these objectives while we earn some trust. If prospects don’t trust us, we won’t see results no matter how fine-tuned our gated content strategy is. So how far do you go?  What are the rules?"

## Covid impact to your workload 
Your work load probably doubled since COVID because you know, all the budget for events had to go somewhere else and it went online. So yeah, we've been super busy since then, but it's been a great opportunity to prove, um, what digital marketing can do and for us to mature and software GE has recognized the contribution that we make as investing we're in this area. So it's very exciting time, I think for all B2B marketers to be, um, in digital marketing growth marketing. 

Yeah, that's a tough one because, because like you said, we have so many products, so we actually define our ideal customer profile at that business unit level. So we, um, and then even in some cases, because the use cases are so different within the business units, we have maybe a split like two ideal customer profiles. So to aggregate them is difficult because you end up with a very broad generic, um, 

Is it like in terms of size, is it from SMEs to enterprise? Is it like, 

Yeah. Yeah. So to give you some parameters, you're right. I'm more in the enterprise space, but also SMEs. Um, so I would say companies with a turnover starting at 100 million upwards to, you know, sky's the limit. Um, but typically I guess 50 billion would be the parameter we would, um, put around that and it's really all industries. So we do service all industries, I'd say, um, our sweet spot is probably manufacturing, retail, consumer goods, telco energy government. I mean, w we're we're in, in the, in the mall financial services to also be before. 

Yeah. That's, that's a broad spectrum also for your digital marketing team then. 

Yes. Yes. And it's, um, we've we've yeah, I won't get into it now, but we have tried different approaches of a horizontal approach versus a vertical market approach. And depending on swings, uh, you know, from one approach to another, um, you know, from one year to another sexually 

And w what is the current, um, theme that you, that you're running then? 

So we, we don't really go with a vertical approach until it's, um, further down the funnel at the top of the funnel. We're not adopting an, a vertical approach. Um, it's much more valued drivers use cases, things like that. And then, um, when we're, you know, our, our SDR, since development reps and inside sales teams are engaging, then that's where the vertical content comes more into play. 

Okay, cool. Um, and which digital channels are you generally using white now for top of funnel, as well as for maybe further down the funnel? 

Yeah. So, um, top of funnel, we're using hot, well, all of the paid media channels. So whether it's linked in, um, we do ABM with 6 cents. We're going to start with tech targets tomb. Um, obviously we do PPC, which is still huge, right. Um, so all of the search engine marketing, um, SEO is still a big channel for us. So the organic version of PPC, um, they're all top of funnel tactics, I'd say email webinars, which is kind of like an asset class, but also a channel, depending on if it's a webinar platform. Um, they're more mid funnel tactics that worked very well for us to help nurture people along. And I would say, um, obviously hybrid events, um, are play a role in that, uh, phase of the funnel as well. Um, yeah, I think they're, they're the key ones. We obviously work very closely with our SDRs at those consideration and evaluation, evaluation phases of the funnel as well. And they have their own sets of tactics that compliment what we're doing in the demand generation, um, part of the organization. 

Yeah. I have a question going to this direction. Um, so, um, what in your point of view is, is wrong when a marketing team is incentivized, um, with, um, driving a lot of MQs, if this is the main KPI, 

Great question. In fact, so at software G we used to have that as our main girl, everyone in the demand generation and growth marketing was incentivized and targeted at generating empty bags. And what that of course leads to is, you know, a certain set of tactics being used to push people or drive people to forums and, you know, increase their lead score so that they reach the threshold of becoming an empty lot. And then, you know, marketing's done, we had our bonus checks 

Well over the fence and says, can do whatever I get my, 

And it doesn't work like that because, you know, sales and complaints, the quality of leads are not where they should be. The conversion rates are low and we're just, you know, draining their resources and time and following up on things that shouldn't really be at an MQL stage. Those, those people are not necessarily ready to engage with, um, an SDR or a sales person. So we've, um, we've kind of got away from MPLS. We still track at that level. Um, but we're not incentivized at that level. 

So what, what did you change to go away from the typical MQL model that, that most companies still use for the marketing team? What, what did you change? 

Yeah, so with ginger, a number of things, um, the first is with our are significant, wonderful, new CMO. She's, she's not that new, but I she's got this over a half a year now and she can 

Do, I would say, 

Yeah, that's true. Like, it feels like, oh, she's there longer, she's made such an impression. Um, so she's kind of scrubbing the term empty well from our vocabulary, which is already a shift in the mindset. So she refers to it as AQL, which is automated, um, qualified lead, which essentially is a better description for a lot of the tactics you use in the digital marketing, um, traffic generating and response generating part of what we do top of funnel, because we're not as a marketing organization, really touching them the tools and technology we have, you know, are, are doing that. So, um, we've also started, you know, really stripping out the forms that we use. So we use far less forms than we used to. And we're trying to how we nurture people at that top stage of the funnel is really, you know, we have a whole digital strategy in place. Um, I don't know if we have the time to get into it in this call, but it's not targeted at really driving towards the form. It's really increasing the engagement with the knowledge that it usually takes between eight and 15 touches before someone's ready to engage with an SDR and have them follow up on that lead. Right. Um, so we have, you know, models in place that, that do that, whether it's retargeting or nurturing different stages of the awareness phase of the funnel and the consideration phase before the SDRs come into play. 

Can we, can we go a little bit deeper there and, um, and maybe you can, you can tell us one or two, um, tactics, like hands on things that maybe someone else could adapt for their own company. Um, that work really well at these two stages, like the awareness and the decision stage. 

Sure. So, um, we, we've just gone through a content audit. Um, so we have, you know, complete audit of all the content we have and it's in the region of 800 pieces of content when you take into account localized version. So it's a lot, way too much actually. And, um, what we do is we we've identified the gaps in the content. We have a lot of, um, actually too much in the consideration phase and evaluation 

Phase. 

Right? So not enough in the top of funnel phase, because you know, for many companies, that's the dark funnel, right? The, 

If you kind of measure it doesn't exist. Some people think at least, but you recognize it. It exists. Yeah. 

Yeah. Yeah. Well, in order to recognize it, you have to have, you know, certain technology and MarTech in place to be able to capture and move those people in increase the engagement at the awareness stage. So each year we've categorized our content, the phases of the buyer journey, it's three stages, awareness, um, consideration and evaluation, and all of our digital ads also aligned to those phases. So the content that we're using at the awareness phase, typically stuff like videos, infographics, um, blogs, listicles, stuff like that. And when someone engages with those ads or, you know, wherever we're syndicating, that content drawing them into our, our campaign pages, um, then you're gonna ch either one of two or three paths for them. So if they're an unknown contact for us, we, and they don't, self-select something where we captured that data from the art, then we'll retarget them, but we will retarget them maybe only with another one awareness piece before we move them into the next phase and target them with more, um, second phase content might be stuff like, you know, eBooks webinars, guides, um, maybe a white paper, stuff like that. 

And so with UTM tracking, we're able to determine who's clicking on ads and engaging with content at each stage of the funnel and then ring, fence them and move them to the next phase and serve them up call to actions and offers that are more suited to that phase of the journey. And that's, that works really well in terms of, you know, tracking the progress of people through the buyer journey. Also, um, you know, when we're talking about engaging with sales of having this data driven approach takes a lot of the emotion out of the conversation. When, you know, you can show, here are the facts, and this is how we're moving people through. And this is also at a granular level, some of the, um, things you can do to improve this as well. So it kind of gives you a baseline for a different type of conversation with sales. 

And how does SAIS help you then, um, in this whole process. 

So we've become a lot tighter with our sales counterparts. Um, they're very much like now we're in the thick of planning for next year. They're totally involved in the conversations and, um, discussions that we're having. And similarly we're involved in there's, it's like we've become one team essentially, and we're all incentivized now, um, uh, as QoS, which are sales, qualified opportunities, rather than 

NCDs have the same KPI Revenue on top of course, but I mean, SQLs, um, so sales qualified opportunities is it's the same KPI for both departments. 

Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it is because we start partnering more and marketing from a demand gen, like the program work that I do and the product marketing counterpart I worked with were just as much interested now in the assets and support we provide for our SDRs and sales counterparts, as we are in the external assets we put out in the market. So things like talking points, cheat sheets, competitor comparisons, sales kits, things like that become just as important because we're now, you know, also incentivized to make sure that those leads get through the funnel and, you know, reach that SQL stage and that there are, um, AR STR teams have the right tools and understanding to follow up on those leads, but also B that those leads are likely to be more ready to engage and have that conversation because we haven't prematurely followed up with them. 

Yes. Um, can you quickly also define for us when a lead becomes a sales qualified opportunity? 

So we have a few different stages in that process, um, after it becomes an AQL, this, this will be the terminology that the systems also reflect next year. Um, then the, this, the, usually there's a human touch 10, so the SDRs follow up and they go through their qualification model. Yeah. There's various ones, but I think most of them follow the bench model, but they got the authority need and so forth. And they, um, for a period will engage with that prospect until they have enough understanding if this is something that they can pass over to the account executives, the account executives review it in the system, it switches then to an Sal sales accepted lead, or as an S RL, a sales rejected lead, in which case it boomerangs back. And we in marketing try to keep that lead warm and nurture it for a period. 

Um, because you know, maybe they were disqualified on, let's say budget, but next year they have budget or, um, authority, but next year they're promoted. And the role changes. So once the sales team, the cat executive has acceptably, they do their own due diligence and discovery work. And once they then switch it to an sq, oh, there's kind of like the clock is ticking for them in a way, because it then enters the system as an opportunity in there. Uh, the sales leadership obviously wants to see progression. So, um, you know, for a salesperson to enter it as an opportunity, they need to be reasonably confident that there's a solid opportunity here. 

Okay. Very good. And, um, besides like changing incentives, um, what is it that your company or your, your, your, your team basically implement so that marketing and sales works closer together? 

Um, so there's the incentive there's, you know, like I mentioned this, having more meetings and alignment, um, and on a regular basis, we have, um, for each region steering calls, monthly steering calls, where we bring the whole group together, which includes our digital sellers, um, everyone involved in the program, the, the, um, the entire growth marketing team and really, you know, go through what's new in the program, but also retrospectively how are the numbers stacking out? What's working. What's not, what can we optimize when the key kind of, um, things we've made to steer in another direction? Um, so that's kind of a collaboration with 

The once a month, um, big meeting in other departments, basically all the, the, the business units where sales and marketing gets together. 

Yeah. Not the entire sales team, but the digital sellers. So these SDRs that are next in line before the account executives come on board, 

And 

We do that then for each region. But even in between that, we have also, you know, regular syncs, 

What, for example, because that's interesting because I put myself in the shoes of someone who says, yeah, um, it makes sense what you're doing, but what do I do in practice? Like, what are the tactics, um, not only the strategy to make it work and to bring those people. I mean, it's always people, and if you bring people together, it, it works. But how do you do it so that it works? Yeah. 

So, well, maybe, maybe it's because I've got my planning hat on now. So at the moment we're sinking constantly. I see my colleagues more than I see my kids and husbands and, um, you know, the, the sales side of this digital sellers and the solution team are very much involved in our planning discussions and will remain. So until we see how things are progressing until we get that back, um, is this message resonating, or do we need to take a different tack? What response are the SDR is getting on the phone and in there, you know, human engagement that we can feed back in to optimize our programs and our campaigns. And maybe it's maybe marketing comes up with a term that we think is great, but actually no one's searching for, or it's not a, an opportunity or pain point for them. Um, and that feedback you get really from the SDRs in a way that we in marketing, you know, we don't have that interface 

And that's magic because they have the direct access to the ones you want to basically have as a client. So, um, I think this is super valuable. What you're doing there. Is it also from time to time that you are, um, on, on some of those comments are listening in 

No, not at software ag. Um, they kind of just feed back to us. Um, what they do are our field marketing people, um, are very closely aligned. And what our SDRs do is firm. They have a kind of a calendar of what they call concert days, where it like sprints, where they focus on one particular, let's say, um, maybe a subset of a business unit even. And usually that's aligned to campaign that's running or part of a program that's running. So we're kind of warming up the market for them ahead of their day, where they're all calling, they've all practice there, their talking points, they're fluid and know what they're following up on. They understand the leads that are coming through. Um, so these kinds of sprints are very useful, I think for, um, you have to get everyone focused and everyone working together. Yeah. 

Yeah. It makes sense. Then once you get someone get to know someone personally, it's much easier to pick up the phone and just have a short conversation or get some information. 

Yeah. And we're all on Microsoft teams, which I love. So everyone, we have a very open flat kind of hierarchy, culture and message each other in between it's, um, you can get everyone, everyone clubs together that way, which is great. 

So if you would take a step back with me and put yourself into the shoes of a company or a marketing leader that still is in the old model of a sales marketing, two separate units, one NPS, the other one, always like, and they basically are not really happy with one another. The one says, well, I give you enough leads. The other one says the leads are not good enough. Um, but you want to move into the golden era of where software is now, um, has not moved, um, on a very high level. What, what do you have to take to make it happen? 

So this comes back to what I was saying earlier. You need to, first of all, I think have the MarTech in place. You need to be capturing that data. So you understand what impacts the marketing's having, um, and, and understand what's performing. And what's not, that gives you a whole, their friend baseline to, you know, align and have those conversations with sales. Would that, that becomes motional become often blame game. Um, so I think that's the first step. And then probably the second is really that alignment has to happen in my opinion, at the leadership and exec level, they need to agree on joint KPIs, um, that they're going after. And, uh, that then eventually, you know, transcends down into all of the other actions that both parts of the organization are taking. I think that, that alignment and buy-in at the CMO, um, CCO and, you know, whatever chief revenue officer as well, they need to be on, on page with that model. 

Yeah. Yeah. I saw a few companies, like, for example, G2, they implemented the chief revenue officer role that has marketing and sales under one roof. So that goes even a step further, not having two separate people, but having one person responsible for both. 

Yeah. We used to have this action. We used to have it a few years ago. Um, but now our marketing, our CML reports into the CEO and, um, I actually prefer the model that we have now. Um, because it, it gives more room for you, no longer term strategic initiatives that aren't just tactical and sales focused. Yeah. 

Uh, if you ever see all that, it's more sales focused. I understand what you're, what you're pointing to. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. So, um, and, and that was really insightful because when I talked to marketing associates also, especially with bigger organizations, um, they swatted with this and, uh, they want to know how can you basically move into, um, into this new world where marketing and sales should work together. So thanks a lot already for that insight. It was really good. 

Maybe one thing I'd add there, Sammy is, so it's something that we're doing at the moment. And we did, we kind of do it on a quarterly basis. We call them pipeline acceleration, hacks, um, and what these are, is like, we essentially looked at who's in the opportunity stage of the funnel right now. And from a marketing point of view, we kind of ring fence them and target them through email nurturing with content that's, um, you know, designed for that final evaluation or in some cases, the consideration phase of the funnel. And then we, in addition to the email nurturing, we, um, do ABM targeting with 6 cents. So we define a list, or actually we take the list of accounts that we have in our opportunity phase, put them through 6 cents and understand which accounts in our funnel are actively searching for the topics we're serving up at the moment. 

So which ones are showing intent or, you know, or are researching at the moment and they're then classified as higher priority, um, customer or prospects. And the third tactic we use as part of this pipeline and celebration process is we do a kind of a, an account surround on LinkedIn. So we will take the opportunity accounts, put them into LinkedIn layer on the different targeting filters that LinkedIn offers in line with our ideal customer profile and, um, serve up the, you know, messaging and call to actions for that stage of the funnel as well. And this has proved to be very helpful at moving con uh, prospects through the funnel. This is something that also, um, you know, our sales colleagues are very positive about. 

So your so social selling basically is also a big, uh, big tool, um, or a big way of enabling, um, the, the sales qualified opportunities to move faster through the funnel. 

Absolutely. That's yeah, that's even a separate thing that our SDRs do. So they have their own tactics as well, but we're far more aligned with how they do it now. Cause they're, you know, we're not working in silos as much anymore, but they kind of do it as a continuation of the, the narrative and the experience that has been initiated in marketing. 

So your SDRs are also actively doing outreach via LinkedIn to acquire new leads. 

Yeah. They have a tool called outreach as well, which is a kind of, uh, um, another mail program, not as, um, full-scale as what we use in marketing. These Marquetto automated, um, marketing, email marketing, um, but they, they certainly do their own prospecting and outreach. And, uh, on LinkedIn, LinkedIn harasses is one of, probably our best channel when it comes to lead gen. Whereas, um, I would say Google display is probably best for top of funnel, Google search as well, the generating awareness and traffic, first of all, displayed then search and LinkedIn for, for leads. 

Okay. One question out of curiosity. I mean, I assume that your, your sales people like STRs, and then in the later stages, the AEs, they build up a network of connections, um, with, with potential clients. Not everybody will become a lead, but at least you have them as a connection on LinkedIn. Do you somehow utilize this connection already? 

So personally me personally, I try to, um, 

Well, I mean, as a marketing team, basically, because just as an example, you have a hundred STS and there is, um, each one of those has a hundred potential clients as a, as a contact in different stages of the funnel. There is 10,000 people where you have a personal connection to, um, and you could do different things, you know, uh, you could publish like posts, for example, that are relevant, or you could, um, use depending on the stage and on the industry, certain kinds of messages that resonate or are more likely resonating with the target group. 

Yeah. So that's a great question. So we, we do, um, we, we have a, an, a tool it's, I only know the internal name of the tool. We call it SAC beat, but it's based on, I can't remember the dynamics or something it's called, and we kind of promote this social selling over this tool. So every post that is going out on our social channels is first of all, collated in this tool, and there's this kind of like a gamification almost that, um, gives the everyone marketing and sales points when they post share like the, the posts that are put there and make an accrue points and then redeem them for, you know, vouchers and goodies and things. Um, so that's one way of incentivizing the SDRs to engage with their own personal connections. Um, I have in the past also worked with, um, vendors like lead zoom, but LinkedIn regularly Colts, uh, software tools like this automate the connection request and the followup, um, messaging. So I think they're probably trying to develop that if they haven't already something in-house that does that. 

I'm not sure if they want to have this, because if they would be a tool that enables you to automate these messages, uh, I assume that the amount of messages will increase a lot. Um, and I'm not sure if LinkedIn wants us, because my guess is it's not hard to develop. Um, it's, I mean, there are a lot of like, um, even small, small companies and developers who you such tools for very cheap and these spots. So my guess is LinkedIn doesn't want you to do this and they don't offer an API, um, to, to get direct access to the data. So, um, let's see where they're going. Um, I'm curious. Yeah, but they, they have like a, uh, they sit on a goldmine, I think, and they, and they're not utilizing it yet completely. And they're not enabling you as a client to, to use it to its full potential. Yeah. 

Yeah. I, I think there's some interesting things coming out of them. Like there, they beta tested, this are currently beta testing, the reviews. I personally think for B2B, that's a huge space with a lot of potential. If you look at the power of the views in the pizza C sector, you go on to Amazon and you're going to, I always go to review. 

Everybody does. And what do you do then you look at the, I always look at the bad ones because it gives you more insight of what's 

Right. What my potential down there is buying this product. I agree. And, and they've, um, so they're beta taste testing that at the moment. And I think, 

Yeah, so we're part of that beta program and we have, um, a product page where other LinkedIn users can go on and write good or bad reviews, but as part of your then, you know, company profile channel, um, just like the other tabs that you would have, you know, events and so forth. So yeah, I think, you know, G2, Capterra all of these other peer review sites, even Gardner, they could see LinkedIn move in there because it is such an active community and people really do go regularly and, you know, consume content and post network. 

Um, so let's just use a little bit, the word is changing, especially for marketers because, um, I mean, you see it in this big companies like apple, or generally we are moving more and more into a cookie, less word. So to say, so it's getting harder to track all those stages as you used to. Um, what, what is the key that you, in your point of view, what is the key to be also successful when we move more and more into this cook? Less word. 

That's a great question. So there's a lot, lot of, um, discussion about this as we prepare for that change next year. So, um, I think first and foremost, I would say get more comfortable with the data that you have and, and develop, um, you know, derive more value from it. I think a lot of B2B companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data. Again, if you don't have the tools, it's difficult to see what's going on. So you have to have that kind of backbone to begin with. But if you do, um, you know, then you can, you can start integrating your pieces of MarTech so that the data that you have on prospects and customers is a lot more insightful. So one of the things we've done with one of our own products, and we use all of our own products internally to transform, you know, how we market. 

So we use wet methods, it's, um, you know, our, uh, integration platform to integrate SAP with Salesforce, for example. So that that customer data is available in Salesforce. For example, all of our cloud customers who are subscription customers, we can see when their renewal contract is up and make sure then that we're, you know, winning share of mind a month or two before. So it increases the likelihood of them renewing. So I would say, you know, use what you have and try and break down silos so that you get more data insight across your market. That's number one, number two, I think, um, very important is intent marketing. So with cookies going, a lot of the, uh, people would consider intense marketing tools are going to have difficulties next year because they've relied on those cookies, right? To gather the IP data of, and build up an account profile. 

But there are other tools out there. And one I'm really excited about that. Our CMO, uh, has recognized too, is, is a huge, um, opportunity for us. It's tech target and tech target is, um, two things really it's like a walled garden. So they have a, a huge army of, uh, content producers and online publications where they're writing about topics that are relevant for us in our market. And instead of, you know, providing kind of generic, um, intelligence on this account is searching for topics you're interested in, they do it on a contact level. So do you consume any of the content and tech target sites you register once and then that's it. You don't have to do it again. So it's a relatively low barrier to get people to become members. They call them, um, in their community and they have millions and millions of that will 

Just be my next question. How big is this community? 

Gosh, I had the number in, 

But I mean, it must be, it must be interesting enough for you because you, you see enough potential clients in this. 

Yeah, absolutely. It's, it's double digit millions down the, I can remember that the number, but it's on, particularly in the us and strong it BJ a little less so in Europe, I would say in the middle east, um, but a very strong marketing intent platform and a good place to do content syndication as well, because what it does is it delivers you on a contact level, the whole firmographic technographic and behavioral intelligence of what that contact and the buyer group that is associated with that contract contact is doing. What you can do then is pass that information over to my kettle, for example, automatically so that it triggers your nurture strings or have that information be automatically sinked in your Salesforce. So that on a contact level so that the SDR is now okay, before they reach out to someone, this contact is actively searching for these topics. This is how I'm going to craft my conversation. 

So you get the data on a personal level. So, you know, for example, if I'm a user of, of, um, well, I'm looking at some blocks and I find something interesting, they know exactly, Hey, Sammy looked at these three content pieces and then, um, they pass it on to their clients like you, um, and you can utilize it and then target me directly and say, Hey, I saw that you liked this content. And then you do whatever makes sense. In this case, either you give me more information or you have an, a CRV jot, whatever makes sense. Yeah, 

Exactly. You may not even say so unless it was your own content. I think it would probably come across as creepy to say, Hey, Tammy, I saw you were searching for that. If it is your own clearly your own content, then I think it's an okay follow up to say, you know, I know you've been interested in this. Um, but yeah. 

And if not, what do you do then? How do you bridge this gap? So there's not creepy. 

Yeah. Well, you can, you don't have to refer to the content that they've consumed at all, but it's just a signal for you that this person has a need or something that they're trying to solve because they're spending time researching in this area. So it's, it's a, it's an indicator to the sales, um, the digital sellers, what, what their pain point is, what you need to try to solve. So how to kind of open the door and start the conversation. 

And is it like, so it's, it's, it's, it's interesting because I never heard about that before. So I imagine now what are the next steps that you can do? I mean, I understand that, of course, if you have the contact data, then an SDR could reach out with a sequence that makes sense, depending on what the person looked at, but what if it's not an SDR or in your point of view, they are not ready for the stage or the step yet, what could you do? 

Well, you could, um, you know, triggered the nurture email nurture and Marquetto, so that you're sending know a drip feed, a certain cadence of message that helps progress them along until they're ready for that conversation with the SDR, or you can also retarget. Um, so you, you, could we take that group of people that are engaging with your content on tech target and do a surround campaign on LinkedIn or on other channels, right. So you can, um, you know, increase your ex your exposure to more members of the buyer group on different channels by having, let's say that Intel on three or four people searching on, on tech target. Yeah, 

Yeah, absolutely. Makes sense. I have to have a look at this. Yeah. Interesting. Um, and it's a kind of competition to Google, to these big ones where everybody said no way that anyone has a chance to talk to them. But I mean, these are the ways where you build a community where people are willing to give the data for, for good content. And, um, then you don't need Google anymore for re-targeting maybe, but still, um, they are eating some of the pie that Google has. Yeah. 

Yeah. I think especially next year, they're not cheap, but I think, um, you know, if, if I think a lot of B to B companies probably could do it simplification, at least in my past roles, you know, there might be tools in the MarTech stack that aren't delivering value. I think if you, you know, clear some of them out and go big on, on one tool and have it as your kind of centerpiece of your digital strategy, particularly as we're going into this cookie, this world, it can make a lot of sense. 

Yeah. Um, so what role does safe generated content play for you and your company? 

A huge role? I mentioned earlier all the content we have, like, 

Yeah. So, um, I mean, you know, in spite of the fact that we've kind of, we're kind of in a world where a brand is what the market says, it is what your customers and influencers say it is rather than what we say it is. In spite of that, I think still content is king. And the content we produce is obviously what's drawing people in, in the beginning then engagement, um, increasingly, and this is something we'll probably be giving more attention next year, developing that ecosystem of influencers, guest bloggers, and things like that will become more important. So it's not just, you know, a broadcasting of, of one voice, but there's several voices. Um, but having said that still, I, you know, self generated content is, is the key. And it's not just the job of marketing, it's the job of, you know, various different, uh, contributors across the company. And I think if you can get your execs onboard as well, um, in creating content it's, uh, it's going to help a lot. For example, we have, um, a series that our corporate comms team runs with our different execs. So there's a one for the CEO. There's one for the CR H C 

T R. 

Um, also our, our success, uh, CR exacts and, um, the CP or product officer where they try and talk to third or sorry, thought leaders, you know, so looking at the topics and more of the strategic point of view beyond our own, you know, our own garden. Um, and I think when you get content like that, it can be incredibly helpful at the top of the funnel. Um, you know, rather than just everything coming out of marketing. 

So is this, um, the content that's performing best for you? 

Um, because I don't know if it's, it's performing best, that's relatively new that we're doing it. So I don't really have enough data on that to say it's performing best. And it's been gone by Corp comms and hasn't really been amplified by us yet to the extent that I could say, yeah, that's, that's really, uh, performing best. I think you have to break it down again by different stages of the funnel, you know, off the bat, I would say best performing content for us would be our analyst reports. So where, you know, Gartner magic quadrants, Forrester waves, things like that. That's half competitive analysis and market analysis. Um, but you know, top of funnel, we're talking about much different things like, uh, you know, videos, um, blogs, stuff like that. So it really depends on what stage of the funnel 

And at top of funnel, when you have these content pieces, um, where do you place them? Of course, your own entity on websites. Understandably. Um, what else do you do when you have, like, for example, you have your CEO in the video with the thought leader, um, where would you push this? 

So obviously we put it on a YouTube channel. That's the second largest search engine in the world, um, in the meantime, so that's a key one. Um, but we use also other, um, third-party sites. So this, this notion of contents indication as well, becomes important, um, Corp comms leverages the CEO interviews to get byline articles in top media publications. Yeah. So that can be, um, a good door opener for that or something that they cover. And then I piggyback on with, um, the demand gen piece, um, yeah, obviously social media channels, as well as, you know, a big one to put out there. 

Perfect. I come to my almost last question, um, because we are running out of time. Um, unfortunately, um, what, what big trends do you see coming that's, um, that's maybe influenced or that you already see, um, successfully implemented by B2C companies and that's coming to B2B as well? 

I think reviews, definitely one. We touched on that. Um, so that's coming and I would say also, um, influencer marketing kind of closely linked in a way to reviews. Um, but I think, you know, if you look at the B to C sector, they're far more advanced in how they use influencers 

And it worked on me too. I bought stuff on Instagram. I mean, 

I try, but, um, yeah, I, I know influencer marketing is, it has got a lot of potential that B2B has only scratched the surface. 

Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, I was skeptical, but, um, it, it just works. And, um, especially I think the work more and more for the ones, like, I don't know, maybe up to 40 that are a little bit more open to these things. Um, and they're more and more becoming the decision-makers for, for, uh, for you and for everybody in B2B. So it will not go away will become more. Um, so let's move to our five rapid fire questions at the end. Um, what do you do to keep body in mind for 10 shop? 

So, um, I love swimming. Um, I used to swim a lot early in the morning, um, since COVID hit and we moved to the countryside. So now I have only lakes, so it's a little difficult this time of year. Uh, so I have a full body red suit, but that takes some time to get into and early in the morning, it's, it's, that's what they do. Um, so I, I run and cycle, I try and get out in nature. 

Y I've thrown in the end, running, cycling, swimming. You got it. 

I, yeah, I don't, I don't do triathlons. Most of my, my family does. Um, but I, I don't like the competitive aspect of it. I like to use sport to work, switch off rather than get jacked up. 

Yeah. But I understand both sides. I do triathlon, but, um, I enjoy training often more than the base itself. Um, so, and for me, it's not about being fast. I will never become faster. So, um, it's uh, but it's, it's nice to do something, um, regularly. 

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Especially when your job is really online, so much. 

Yeah. Sitting all the time of like this screen. Yeah. Um, you have to get moving a little bit each day. Um, do you have a favorite business book? 

Um, there's, there's a lot, um, I'd say one that sticks to mind or comes to mind would be black box thinking by Matthew said, I don't know if you know that one, but it's, um, it comes from the idea of the black box in the cockpit of an airplane. So that's where the title comes from, but really it's about how to make small minor improvements and changes to really transform. So it's what I call the salami tactic, you know, little slices at a time, we'll get you to the end of the salami. Right. Rather than looking at it as a whole, a whole chunk. So, um, yeah, I, I liked that form of approach. Um, there are some, you know, you can have big bang moments and some books that had big impacts on me, um, that has probably influenced my life more. But in terms of business, I think that's a good, a good message to keep front and center still for the small improvements. And they'll all add up. 

Right. Good. Um, do we have a favorite business leader that you follow? 

Yeah, so there, I I'd have to go with, um, my husband he's, uh, Brian commerce. He's an international TV news anchor and he's, yeah. He's like my, um, my own private news channel. So he thinks me all of the stuff about what's going on in the world that I need to know and care about. And sometimes I, I need to, you know, remote control to switch him off or change the channel, but, um, yeah, he's incredibly knowledgeable and she would be, um, I guess the leader I follow the most. 

Perfect. 

Yeah, yeah, for sure. 

Um, who should be our next podcast guest and why? 

Oh, well, um, I guess you don't want to talk to someone at software EEG again, but if you did, I would say 

I'm open someone who would be interesting for the B2B sales and marketing community, or 

So then I would say our CMO, Don Colossi, she's really such a bright, smart woman and has her game on when it comes to, um, digital marketing and, you know, modern techniques. She's wonderful. Also bill Carney leads our growth, um, marketing. Um, otherwise if you're looking for someone else of another company, does the CMO of bright Cove comes to mind? Her name is Jennifer Griffin Smith. I used to work with her in the past and learned a lot from her. And she's, um, also, uh, a very smart digital marketer, I would say, 

Perfect. I tried to get at least one of those on the show and if they interested, thanks for that. And now you can address our audience. Anything we can help you with Ana. 

Oh, um, wow. So I guess because, um, next year I am interested in exploring this influencer marketing area more, um, also from just a, not just a business reasons, but from a psychology perspective, I'm keen to understand more that area. So if anyone's, um, formalized a marketing program in the B2B sphere, there I'd be interested in learning more or any reading material that someone wants to recommend. I'd love to hear from them.
