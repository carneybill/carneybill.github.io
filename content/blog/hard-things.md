title: "The Hard thing about Breakfast Smoothies"
subtitle: "Book Read"
excerpt: "As I lounged under the Cancun sun with a breakfast smoothie (pina colada) in hand, Ben Horowitz’s words hit me like an unexpected wave: “There are no silver bullets for this, only a lot of lead bullets.” It was an oddly grounding moment—reading about the brutal realities of running a company while surrounded by palm trees and endless turquoise water. His stories of sleepless nights, impossible decisions, and gut-wrenching honesty stood in stark contrast to my lazy beach vibe, but that’s what made them stick. Even from a pre-pandemic world, his lessons on resilience and facing “The Struggle” head-on felt timeless, like the kind of advice you could apply anywhere—even when deciding between tacos or ceviche for dinner."

# Vacation Thoughts on The Hard Thing About Hard Things

I just finished The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz while sipping margaritas on a sunny beach in Cancun, and let me tell you, reading about layoffs and crisis management while surrounded by palm trees is a bit of a vibe clash. But somehow, it worked.

Horowitz doesn’t sugarcoat anything. This isn’t your typical feel-good business book with vague buzzwords and “manifest your success” nonsense. No, this is straight-up: “Running a business is brutal, and here’s how I survived it (barely).” It’s refreshingly real, like a splash of cold water—perfect for when you’re roasting in the sun.

## Nuggets That Hit Hard

The most interesting part for me was how many of his lessons still make sense, even though the book was written ten years ago, long before the chaos of COVID-19 flipped the workplace upside down. Horowitz’s advice on “The Struggle” (his term for when everything is falling apart and you have no idea what to do) feels timeless. Whether you’re dealing with hybrid work headaches or trying to get Wi-Fi at a beach resort (seriously, why is that so hard?), his approach to resilience and tough calls still applies.

His stories are gold, too. There’s something oddly entertaining about reading how a CEO scrambled to save his company while I was trying to decide between fish tacos or nachos for lunch. It’s like he’s saying, “Hey, it might look glamorous, but it’s always a grind behind the scenes.”

## Post-COVID Perspective

That said, it’s hard to ignore that this book comes from a pre-pandemic world. Horowitz writes about managing in-office teams and navigating tech booms, which feels a bit quaint in our era of Zoom fatigue and four-day workweek debates. But his advice about building a strong culture and staying honest with your team? That’s the kind of wisdom that never goes out of style.

Okay, not everything hit perfectly while lounging under a cabana. Horowitz’s tone is sometimes a bit intense—like a business coach yelling at you during your siesta. And some of the tech industry war stories, while fascinating, felt far removed from the chill vibe of the beach. But then again, maybe reading this while away from work made me appreciate it more. It’s the ultimate reminder that leading a company isn’t all pina coladas and sunsets.

## Thoughts

Would I recommend this as a beach read? Weirdly, yes. It’s full of no-nonsense advice that can make you feel a little more prepared to tackle your own “hard things” when you’re back in the grind. Plus, it’s nice to remind yourself that even the most successful people sometimes have no idea what they’re doing.

So, grab a drink, soak up some sun, and let Horowitz’s tough-love lessons sink in. Just don’t take it too seriously—it’s vacation, after all.
