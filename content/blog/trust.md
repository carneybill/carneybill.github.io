subtitle: "Ask More, Pretend Less"
excerpt: "Vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s strength. I just finished *Getting Naked* by Patrick Lencioni and *Don’t Believe Everything You Think*. The lesson? Clients don’t want superheroes. They want real people who ask the tough questions, admit when they don’t know, and put the client first. That’s how trust is earned. That’s how partnerships grow. That’s how we lead. "

I recently finished two books that struck a chord with me. The first was *Getting Naked* by Patrick Lencioni (thanks to Kevin MacKey for the recommendation). The title might raise eyebrows, but the message is simple: to earn trust, we have to strip away the need to appear perfect.  

The second was *Don’t Believe Everything You Think*, which reminded me that so much of our inner dialogue is shaped by fear:  
- “You’ll lose credibility if you don’t have the answer.”  
- “Don’t say that — it’ll make you look weak.”  

This book challenged me to notice how often my thoughts are assumptions rather than truths. Fear-driven thinking can hold us back from asking the right questions, admitting what we don’t know, or collaborating openly. Recognizing that these are just thoughts — not facts — frees us to take risks, engage authentically, and focus on what really matters: the client’s success and meaningful outcomes.  

The truth is this: **vulnerability is strength.**

## What *Getting Naked* Taught Me  

Clients don’t want superheroes with all the answers. They want real people. Advisors who care enough to ask tough questions. Professionals who will say “I don’t know” when they don’t — and then do the work to find out.  

That message lines up with what I’ve been seeing in my own journey and in the way we’re growing as a company. Trust isn’t about slick presentations or flawless delivery. It’s about being real.

## Vulnerability in Action  

Here’s what I’d like to challenge all of us (myself included) to practice this month:  
- Walk into meetings not with all the answers, but with great questions.  
- Say *“I don’t know”* when you don’t — and follow it with *“But I’ll find out.”*  
- Be willing to look “dumb” if it helps the client feel seen, understood, and served.  
- Offer help beyond what’s scoped. Show you care about the bigger picture.  
- Admit where you’re stuck — and let others help you move forward.  

Over the past couple of months, we’ve had dozens of introductions turn into second and third conversations. That hasn’t happened because we were the slickest voice in the room. It’s happened because we were **real**.

## How We Lead  

So let’s keep being real. Let’s walk through the doors we’ve opened not trying to impress, but trying to understand. Let’s partner instead of pitch.  

Because trust isn’t built when we show up perfectly polished.  

It’s built when we show up **honest. Human. Curious.**  

If you haven’t read *Getting Naked*, I encourage you to pick it up. But even if you never crack the cover, you can live the message:  
- Ask more.  
- Pretend less.  
- Be willing to be wrong.  
- Be eager to serve.  

That’s how trust is earned. That’s how partnerships grow. And that’s how we lead.  

Let’s keep showing up — open, curious, and unafraid.  

**Let’s go,**
