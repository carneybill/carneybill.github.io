Have you ever felt stuck in a job that no longer challenges you or rewards you for your efforts? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work in a different company or industry that values your skills and potential? Many professionals face the dilemma of whether to stay in their current role or seek new opportunities elsewhere. In this blog post, I’ll share my personal story of how I grew my career by leaving jobs on my terms, even when it meant giving up the comfort and security of my familiar workplace. 
## The Power of Self-Recognition 
One of the most important lessons I learned early in my career was to recognize my own value. It’s easy to get complacent and settle for less when you’re used to doing the same tasks and receiving the same feedback every day. However, I realized that I had more to offer than what my current job required or appreciated. 
## The Quest for External Recognition 
One of the first steps I took to advance my career was to actively seek external recognition for my work. It was a risky move, but I knew that sometimes, you have to look beyond your immediate work environment to find people who can see your true potential. I started networking, attending industry events, and sharing my expertise online. Soon, I was connecting with professionals who respected my work and offered me support and guidance. The Opportunity for Growth As I continued to expand my external network and showcase my insights, something amazing started happening. I began receiving offers from other companies that recognized my worth and were ready to reward me accordingly. These offers not only included higher salaries but also more senior titles, reflecting my actual skill level and career stage. 
## The Challenge: 15% Increase or 3% Over 4 Years? 
At one point, I found myself facing a significant career choice. My current employer offered me a 4% salary increase, which was consistent with the annual raises I had received over the past four years. They thought this was great.  They were rewarding me for the good work I was doing irrespective of the market and what it was rewarding.  After all, companies manage by budget and then distribute it. However, an alternate company offered me a 15% salary increase for an identical position. 
## The Decision for Growth 
While the prospect of a 15% increase was appealing, I couldn’t ignore the fact that my current job had become somewhat routine. The 4% raise was nice, but it didn’t match my aspirations for personal and professional growth. I decided to take the plunge and accept the offer with the 15% increase, along with the chance for new challenges and responsibilities. 
## The Reward of Change 
This decision to change jobs for a 15% increase wasn’t just about the money. It was a decision to invest in my own growth and development. It allowed me to gain new perspectives, work on innovative projects, and collaborate with new colleagues who valued my skills. 
## Beware the naysayers 
I had a boss who tried to convince her entire organization not to jump “You’ll see, you jump for the money and you’ll be the first to go when times get lean”. She had an opportunity to reward folks that were delivering for her but she chose fear - she often did. In fact, they had a layoff shortly after that where 10% were cut. Most of my team called me after that all-hands and I encouraged them to just do the math and make the decision for themselves.  If I can’t provide what they need to grow personally or financially IMHO they have every right to secure it elsewhere. Loyalty is earned not given.
## Conclusion: Your Career, Your Terms 
Leaving jobs on your terms is a powerful way of expressing your self-worth and ambition. It’s a reminder that your career is a journey, and you have the right to steer it in a direction that meets your goals. So, don’t be afraid to look for recognition outside your current workplace and make strategic moves that propel you toward the future you want. While a 15% salary increase may seem attractive, the real benefit lies in the growth, opportunities, and personal satisfaction that come with making choices that align with your long-term career vision. Your career path is ultimately yours to shape, and the choices you make along the way are a reflection of your dedication to growth and self-recognition.
