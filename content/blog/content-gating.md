## Content Gating Policies 
We want personal data in exchange for content we work so hard to create. We also want to establish ourselves as thought leader.  Arguably there has always been a need to balance objectives for marketing while we earn reputation and trust. If prospects don’t trust us, we won’t see results no matter how fine-tuned our gated content strategy is.

Gated content will target prospects in the middle to later stages of our buyer’s journey. These prospects may still be exploring their pain points, and they are seeking content that’s more in-depth and more specific than the ungated content they’ve already consumed. We need to use our content mapping and aligning our gate strategy to the later stages of the buyer’s journey

So, we can use this as a rule of thumb…the deeper into the buyer journey a prospect is as well as the deeper the content the more we ought to place a low friction gate in front of it. An additional rule of thumb we should use is be “friendly” gating everything is annoying and not appreciated. We don’t want to have to sift through “Fred Flintstone” as many people have junk email accounts anyway.

No matter if content is gated or not - every piece of material from us should offer a “Subscribe here (email only) to receive notification on when our next webinar becomes available” as well as “Click here to manage your subscription profile”. We should always have a backup mechanism ready as well which in every case will be the “Contact Us” form as well as chat on all of our sites.

We are still trying to develop our thought leadership, so I believe it isn’t the right time to gate content liberally. We need to experiment over time by offering high-quality content on a consistent basis, to earn our audience’s trust.  Once trust is earned, we can then introduce more and more gated content through their journey.

Bizible tracking is key to our success and limited gated content.   We need to ensure full UTM parameter support for robust reporting down to artifact attribution by company.  Bizible is currently setup and tracking all content on our site within Salesforce.  We can now create reporting on content effectiveness without having to gate everything.
