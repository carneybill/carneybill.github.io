Speed is so important to me, my old twitter handle (recommended by a friend) used to be biasforaction. Speed for speed's sake isn't the goal, but doing something and then learning something is much better than inaction. Efforts once completed must be measured. You then continuously and incrementally improve the results over time - but you are constantly moving."

A test and learn approach gives you permission to experiment and build upon successes while learning from failures. With technology improvements, it's getting easier to take on large slow moving organizations that refuse to try innovative approaches. You have to be ready to embrace failures and be open-minded enough to take criticism."

Clients, though not unique, like to feel that way and focus on accounts takes more thought and effort. Account-level specificity has been made easier through advances in tech and allows this focus with greater scaling capability."
